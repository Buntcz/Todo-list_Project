# Todo-list_Project
Todo list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Webpack, will try to implement a database in the end to store all the todos.
(for now i won't include the projects thing, there will be one main project that you will be locked in, sorry about that.)
Things to do:
All parts of creating the projects are done, only need to make it so you can edit the titles.
What do I need to do now:
1. Made a function that creates a taskCard inside the project card, but there is a little problem, it creates it only in the first one created, and then when a new object is created it 
makes another taskCard into the default project, I'll need to find a way to fix that.
2. Find a way how to build a button inside each of the project cards that will be used to create a task for the given project.
3. When the button is a clicked a dialog form will show that will create a task element that will be put into the interface but it will also be added into the myTasks array.
4. Make it so you can delete and edit given tasks.
