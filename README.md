# Todo-list_Project
Todo list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Webpack, will try to implement a database in the end to store all the todos.
(for now i won't include the projects thing, there will be one main project that you will be locked in, sorry about that.)
Things to do:
All parts of creating the projects are done, only need to make it so you can edit the titles.
What do I need to do now:
1. Made it so a created task is console logged and put into the MyTasks array, now it's time to make a logic to create element for each task with all the data it and put in its own taskCArd.
2. Make a great styling.
3. Make a local storage, and make it work.
