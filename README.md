# Todo-list_Project
Todo list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Webpack, will try to implement a database in the end to store all the todos.
(for now i won't include the projects thing, there will be one main project that you will be locked in, sorry about that.)
Things to do:
All parts of creating the projects are done, only need to make it so you can edit the titles.
What do I need to do now:
Made it so a task is displayed but now I have to:
Couldn't fix the bug so I'll just be sticking to one project for now. Current things i need to do in order below.
Storage set up but with a one cost. one is there is no default project for now , sorry.
Also I can't figure out how to make the edit button work so I will try to fix it someday because I want to continue learning.
The project is 90% done without the styling.
I will try to finish the remaining 10% alongside my learning. 
I'll just publish it now.
