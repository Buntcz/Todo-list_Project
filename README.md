# Todo-list_Project
Todo list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Webpack, will try to implement a database in the end to store all the todos.
(for now i won't include the projects thing, there will be one main project that you will be locked in, sorry about that.)
Things to do:
All parts of creating the projects are done, only need to make it so you can edit the titles.
What do I need to do now:
Made it so a task is displayed but now I have to:
!!! RESERACH: CRUD OPERATIONS & DOCUMENTAIONS ON FUCNTIONS AND FUNCTION SCOPE !!!
1. fix the bug where the task is only in the first container.
2. Style it so it looks better(In the end I might just give the ability to change the name of the project, because it looks ugly.);
3. set up the storage.
4. Style
