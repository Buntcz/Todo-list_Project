# Todo-list_Project
Todo list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Webpack, will try to implement a database in the end to store all the todos.
(for now i won't include the projects thing, there will be one main project that you will be locked in, sorry about that.)
Things to do:
1. create the form that you will have to input all the todo data in.
2. create a button that will show the form you have the input the data in.
3. after clicking the submit button, console.log all the data created(to check if everything is working properly).
4. Create an interface that will show each individual task after the button was clicked in a card-like style.
5. include a radio button in the todo card so you can check it when a task is done.
6. Add delete and edit button to the cards, delete will delete the task and edit will allow you to re-open the form to edit stuff that you don't like.
7. Style it to your liking.
Now, get to work.
